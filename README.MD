# Upasthiti

## Getting Started

## Note: This method is specifically used by me. But you can also use other methods as well.

- clone the Repository
- create a new folder for managing virtual environments and create a new virtual environment using 'venv' as `python -m venv upasthiti-env`
- activate virtual environment as

  ```zsh
  # for linux use
  source <location-to-virtual-environment>/upasthiti/bin/activate

  # for windows use
  <location-to-virtual-environment>/upasthiti/Scripts/activate
  ```

- cd into the cloned repo
- run `poetry install` to install all needed deps
